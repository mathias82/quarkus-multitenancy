# ⚙️ Quarkus Multi-Tenancy ORM Deployment

Registers the ORM runtime as a Quarkus feature.

## Responsibilities
- Marks the extension with the feature name `quarkus-multitenancy-orm`
- Makes ORM runtime available to Hibernate ORM layer

You typically won’t need to use this directly, it activates automatically.
